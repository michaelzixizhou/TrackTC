# TrackTC
Made with the frustrations of a daily commuter, TrackTC is a Django and React stack connected by the Django REST Framework! 

## How to use
* Don’t be late:
	* check out the current and planned TTC delays, provided by the TTC API.
* Track your buses:
	* enter your email and buses/trains and we will email you their delay status every 12 hours!
